DSpace Digital Repository
======

DSpace is the open source software that we use at the University of Memphis to both store and share our digital collections. This includes things like pictures, essays, videos, and more.

My job at the Emerging Technologies department was to install this software and all of it's dependencies and write the initial documentation for it's maintenance. 

I created this Git repo to allow easy cloning and migration during testing.
